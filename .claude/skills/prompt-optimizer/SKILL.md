  Rewrite a rough prompt into a model-specific, research-backed prompt for AI
  generation models — video (Veo, Sora, Kling, Seedance, Hailuo, Wan, LTX,
  PixVerse, Vidu…), image (Flux, Midjourney-style, GPT Image, Nano Banana,
  Seedream, Qwen Image, Recraft, Juggernaut…), and text/LLM (Claude, ChatGPT,
  Gemini, Grok). Use this whenever the user wants to generate an image, video,
  or game/creative work with an AI model and asks to write, improve, optimize,
  fix, or "make a good prompt" — even if they only paste a rough idea and name
  a model, or ask "how should I prompt X for Y". Each model family is prompted
  differently; this skill applies the right conventions and, crucially, returns
  the reasoning guide alongside the prompt so the user can keep tweaking it.

# Prompt Optimizer for Generative AI Models

Different generative models want to be prompted in genuinely different ways. A
phrase that helps Flux hurts Kling; a keyword pile that works on an SDXL
checkpoint is ignored by GPT Image; an XML-structured brief that Claude loves
will confuse a diffusion model. This skill turns a user's rough idea into a
prompt shaped for the **specific model they're targeting**, and — just as
importantly — hands back the *why* so they can refine it themselves.

## The single most important principle

**The optimized prompt is a starting example; the guide is the product.** A
generated prompt full of fixed enhancement phrases ("golden hour rim light…")
looks authoritative but is only a reasonable default. What actually makes
someone better at prompting a model is understanding *how that model wants to
be prompted*. So always deliver two things side by side:

1. **A starting-example prompt**, optimized for the target model.
2. **The prompting guide** for that model — the conventions, vocabulary, and
   gotchas — presented as the main event, not a footnote.

Frame the prompt as "a starting point to tweak using the guide," never as a
finished, optimal artifact.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the target model, its family, and its type

Ask or infer: which model, and is it **video**, **image**, or **text/LLM**?
Map the model to its *family* (the provider/architecture line), because
conventions are shared within a family, not per version:

| Type | Families (see reference file) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Video | Seedance, MiniMax/Hailuo, Kling, Veo, Sora, Wan, LTX, PixVerse, Vidu, HappyHorse, Gemini video, Grok Imagine |
| Image | Flux, GPT Image, Nano Banana, Seedream, Qwen Image, Recraft, Kling, Wan, Grok Imagine, Juggernaut, DynaVision, OpenArt, Z-Image |
| Text/LLM | Claude, ChatGPT/GPT, Gemini, Grok |

If the exact model isn't in the references, pick the closest family (e.g. any
SDXL checkpoint → the Juggernaut/SDXL conventions; any Midjourney-style service
→ the image principles below) and say so.

### 2. Read the matching reference file

- Video → `references/video-models.md`
- Image → `references/image-models.md`
- Text/LLM → `references/text-models.md`

Each file has the per-family conventions, negative-prompt behavior, and the
research-backed tips that become the guide.

### 3. Optimize — the method depends on the type

**Image & video** — enhance without overwriting. Keep the user's subject and
intent intact, then *only add what's missing*:

- Detect what the user already specified (lighting, camera, motion, audio,
  materials, style, photography terms, literal text). Never duplicate an
  element they already gave.
- Add missing elements using **mood-appropriate** choices, not blind defaults.
  Read the scene and pick fitting enhancements — see *Mood-aware enhancement*
  below. A neon night alley gets neon lighting; a sunset gets golden light; a
  high-energy action shot gets dynamic lighting. Do **not** staple "golden
  hour" onto everything.
- Apply family-specific rules from the reference file: strip quality tags
  (masterpiece, 4k, best quality) for models that ignore them; strip weight
  syntax `(token:1.4)` for models that don't support it; wrap literal
  text-to-render in double quotes; convert to present tense for video.
- Handle the negative prompt per the model: some support it, some ignore it
  (rewrite negatives as positives — "sharp focus" not "no blur"), some have no
  parameter.

**Text/LLM** — restructure, don't decorate. Rebuild the rough prompt into the
architecture the family responds to (details in `references/text-models.md`):

- **Claude** → XML-tagged sections (`<task>`, `<context>`, `<constraints>`),
  a role line, rationale attached to constraints, an explicit ambition level,
  and a closing self-check.
- **ChatGPT/GPT** → Markdown sections (`# Role and Objective`, `# Instructions`,
  `# Output Format`), no contradictions, an anti-cliché ban-list for creative
  work, explicit verbosity control.
- **Gemini** → concise Persona / Task / Context / Format, context first and the
  ask last.
- **Grok** → a lean, surgical spec plus an "list your assumptions separately"
  clause and an iteration plan.
- If the prompt is about building a **game or interactive app**, inject the
  game formula (core loop, controls, win/lose, the self-contained-HTML
  constraint block, acceptance tests) — see the reference file.

### 4. Deliver the prompt and the guide together

Present the optimized prompt, then the model's prompting guide as prominent
bullets (the actionable vocabulary — camera moves like *dolly/orbit/push*,
structure formulas, emphasis syntax — is what the user should be learning).
Close by noting it's a starting point they shape with the guide.

## Mood-aware enhancement (image & video)

When you need to add lighting/atmosphere, first read the scene's mood and pick
a fitting option instead of a fixed default. Detect from the prompt text:

- **neon** — neon, cyberpunk, synthwave, arcade, hologram → neon/cyberpunk glow
- **energetic** — energy, electric, lightning, magic, evolving, power → dynamic
  high-contrast lighting with glowing accents
- **epic** — fantasy, dragon, battle, storm, space, cosmic → dramatic
  volumetric light, god rays, deep contrast
- **warm** — sunset, sunrise, golden hour, dawn, dusk, cozy, candle → golden
  rim light, warm low sun
- **night** — night, midnight, dark, moonlit, noir → low-key moonlit / cool
  nocturnal lighting
- **nature** — forest, mountain, ocean, meadow, landscape, outdoor → soft
  natural daylight, dappled or overcast
- **studio** (fallback) — portraits, product, indoor, or no cue → clean
  studio / balanced key-and-fill

Phrase the choice in the family's register: **cinematic** for video,
**photographic** for photo-real image models, **stylized** for design/
illustration models (Recraft, DynaVision). Offer to re-roll a different fitting
option if the user wants variation — the point is that it *fits the subject*
and *isn't the same every time*, never that one default is "correct."

## Why this matters

Newer models do exactly what you ask and no more, so unstated scope yields
minimal output; blind defaults produce generic "AI slop"; and a prompt handed
over without its reasoning teaches nothing. Optimizing *with the guide visible*
turns each generation into a lesson in prompting that model well.
